# Outline

After reviewing the survey schema and playing with the multiple choice responses in XL, I figured there is a lot to be learned from this dataset about the data scientists population, including, but not limited to, who they are, where they work and what they do, what skills they have, how they learn and how they find work. Below I have outlined the questions that constitute the path I follow in my exploratory analysis.

#### Survey Statistics
- How many survey responders consider themselves data scientists (DS)?

#### Demographics
 - DS population: country, gender, age, academic background?

#### Job Particulars
 - What are DS population job roles? <br>
 - What are the industries DS work in? <br>
 - How experienced are DS? <br>
 - What are DS job functions? <br>
 - What do DS spend their time on? <br>

#### Skills, Tools, Languages
 - What skills do DS possess? <br>
 - What kind of tools do DS use? <br>
 - What programming languages do DS use?

#### Work Environment
 - How satisfied are DS with their job? <br>
 - What challenges do DS face at work?

#### Learning
 - How do DS squire data science skills?

#### Compensation
 - What kind of money do DS make?

#### Job Search
 - How did DS find their job?
 

## Structure

I work through the above questions one-by-one, making use of <b>descriptive statistics</b>, <b>hypothesis testing </b> and <b>data visualisation</b> in attempt to explore each subject from multiple angles. To show my thought process, I include the following in each section of the analysis: <br>
1. the question of interest,
2. data to be used + method of inquiry,
3. code + visualizations,
4. findings + interpretation.

I conclude the analysis with the summary of what I learned.

# Outline

After reviewing the survey schema and playing with the multiple choice responses in XL, I figured there is a lot to be learned from this dataset about the data scientists population, including, but not limited to, who they are, where they work and what they do, what skills they have, how they learn and how they find work. Below I have outlined the questions that constitute the path I follow in my exploratory analysis.

#### Survey Statistics
- How many survey responders consider themselves data scientists?

#### Demographics
 - country, gender, age, academic background?

#### Job Particulars
 - What are their job roles? <br>
 - What are the industries they work in? <br>
 - How experienced are they? <br>
 - What are their job functions? <br>
 - What do they spend their time on? <br>

#### Skills, Tools, Languages
 - What skills do they possess? <br>
 - What kind of tools do they use? <br>
 - What programming languages do they use?

#### Work Environment
 - How satisfied are they with their job? <br>
 - What challenges do they face at work?

#### Learning
 - How do they continue to learn data science?

#### Compensation
 - What kind of money do they make?

#### Job Search
 - How did they find their job?
 

## Structure

I work through the above questions one-by-one, making use of <b>descriptive statistics</b>, <b>hypothesis testing </b> and <b>data visualisation</b> in attempt to explore each subject from multiple angles. To show my thought process, I include the following in each section of the analysis: <br>
1. the question of interest,
2. data to be used + method of inquiry,
3. code + visualizations,
4. findings + interpretation.

I conclude the analysis with the summary of what I learned.
